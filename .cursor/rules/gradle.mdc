# Gradle Build Rules

## Version Requirements
- Flutter requires Gradle versions between 7.3 through 7.6.1 inclusive
- Android Gradle Plugin (AGP) should be compatible with chosen Gradle version
- Kotlin version should be compatible with chosen AGP version

## Block Ordering
- `pluginManagement {}` must be the first block in settings.gradle
- Only `buildscript {}`, `pluginManagement {}`, and other `plugins {}` blocks allowed before main `plugins {}` block
- `repositories {}` should be defined before dependencies
- `buildCache {}` must be inside `pluginManagement {}` block in settings.gradle, not as a standalone block
- Build scan plugin must be applied before other configuration blocks in build.gradle
