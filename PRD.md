**Project Overview**

CookCut is a video editing Android app tailored for cooking creators, enabling them to efficiently produce and share engaging culinary content. The platform offers intuitive tools for video editing, collaboration, and analytics to enhance content creation and audience engagement.

**User Roles & Core Workflows**

1. As a cooking creator, I want to import and trim raw video clips to create concise cooking tutorials.
2. As a cooking creator, I want to overlay text instructions and timers onto videos to guide viewers through recipes.
3. As a cooking creator, I want to add background music and voiceovers to enhance the viewing experience.
4. As a collaborator, I want to edit shared projects to contribute to content refinement.
5. As a collaborator, I want to comment on specific sections of a video to provide feedback.
6. As a cooking creator, I want to view analytics on my videos to understand audience engagement.

create table public.projects (
  id uuid primary key default uuid_generate_v4(),
  user_id uuid references auth.users not null,
  raw_video_id text not null,
  processed_video_id text,
  edit_operations jsonb not null default '[]'::jsonb,
  status text not null default 'draft',
  created_at timestamp with time zone default timezone('utc'::text, now()) not null,
  updated_at timestamp with time zone default timezone('utc'::text, now()) not null
);

-- RLS Policies
alter table public.projects enable row level security;

create policy "Users can view their own projects"
  on public.projects for select
  using (auth.uid() = user_id);

create policy "Users can create their own projects"
  on public.projects for insert
  with check (auth.uid() = user_id);

create policy "Users can update their own projects"
  on public.projects for update
  using (auth.uid() = user_id);
```
